/**
 * D9 (prompts/snippets/native-window-move.md §7 item 9): a window opened while the head is pitched opens pitched,
 * so every openWindowContainer first asks here and only opens once the head has been level (|pitch| <= 10°) for
 * 300 ms. Pure Kotlin: the caller feeds the time and the head pitch (degrees, + up; null when there is no valid
 * head pose). With no valid head pose for [noHeadMs] it opens anyway, so the window is never stuck.
 *
 * Spatial Calculator opens its one Planar window from the Mixed Stage, so every open (first, reopen after ×,
 * reopen panel) waits for a level head.
